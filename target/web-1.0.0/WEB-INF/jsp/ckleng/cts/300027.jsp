		<p>Hello everyone,</p>
		<p>my name is Song Seong Gak, president of KOCCA.</p>
		<p>Now, we are living in the 'creative economy' where a source of wealth is generated based on creative imagination and ideas of peoples</p>
		<br />
		<p>rather than traditional resources, finances and the size of industry.</p>
		<p>Under such circumstances, Contents Korea Lab serves as a platform to systematically support creative imagination and ideas</p>
		<p>to be developed into creation and business so that contents industry can play a key role in creative economy.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Opening the first center in Daehakro, May 28 in 2014, several regional centers have been established across the nation, providing a space</p>
		<p>to encourage development and creation of cultural contents integration projects such as in game, movie, music and fashion industry.</p>
		<p>It will also serve as a cultural contents creation business hub to support start-up incubating.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Furthermore, we will continue to understand market needs on a new product and a service.</p>
		<p>At the same time, we will expand exchanges and cooperations with innovators and big corporations to gain information and knowledge.</p>
		<p>Also, we will endeavor to provide a proactive and a useful support by dispatching employees with abundant experiences and high skills in</p>
		<p>contents creation and business development.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I ask for your continuous support and attention to Contents Korea Lab so that it serves as an oasis to appease thirst of so-called 'creation nomads'</p>
		<p>We will make strenuous efforts to be a mecca of Korean cultural contents industry.</p>
